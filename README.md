51 equally sized balls are put into an urn numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., 50. 
You will play the following game. 

You draw a number. If that number is 0 you lose and take home nothing.
Otherwise, you can take home the number of dollars on the ball OR you can put the ball back
in the hat and try again.

We determine the optimal strategy and its expected winnings, with a second scenario in which you are required to pay $5 dollars each
time you want to replay the game.
